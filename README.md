## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Postcss](https://postcss.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) 


### What I learned

With this project I've learned some basic configuration on vite and postcss. Also some html semantics like figures and blockquote.


### Continued development

Continue on to apply good Html semantics and accessibility and to transition on using postcss instead of sass.
